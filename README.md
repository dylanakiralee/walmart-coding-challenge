Movie Theater Seating Challenge (2020) for Walmart Labs.

### Assumptions

- After doing some research I found that the most desirable seats were in the center of the rows that are 2/3 away from the screen
- I gave priority to the first reservations in the input file, evaluating each request one by one.

### Instructions for Executing

1. Navigate to the directory where theater.py is located.
2. Run the command `python theater.py input.txt` where input.txt contains the reservation requests.
3. Check the file output.txt for the seating assignments.
